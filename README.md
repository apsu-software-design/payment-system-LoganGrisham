##### Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who (be specific!). #####

##### Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this assignment? #####
> 4-5 minus clarksville wide power outage.


##### On a scale of 1 (too easy) to 10 (too challenging), how difficult was this assignment? #####
> 6. The assignment was basic but the reigns were so loose I didn't know where to start. This coupled with a lack of understanding ts made it not enjoyable.


##### Did you encounter any problems in this assignment we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the assignment better? #####
> Yah, I didn't get that the UI held all the code and was lost and confused. Then I realized you wanted us to split it up, which was a forehead smacking moment.
